## Project Title: The Cocktail Wizard

## Project Description:
Our goal with this project is to design a robot that is able to make a variety of cocktails. After being prompted to make a specific one, it will pour the ingredients and shake if needed, before serving the drink in a glass and presenting it to the customer. The ultimate goal would be for the robot to learn a large number of cocktail and be able to make them quickly.
## Robot
UR10e & RobotIQ 3-Finger Adaptive Gripper.  These were chosen because we will probably need the large work space of the UR10e to get bottles and glasses from shelves and since this project is about cocktails, we need an end-effector able to grasp bottles/Glasses of any shape, Therefore we decided on one that resembles a human hand, albeit a simpler one.
